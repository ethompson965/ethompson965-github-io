/*
* 0. Operators are characters used in Javascript to assign values, compare values, 
* perform arithmetic operations and other executions in code blocks
*/


//Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic between variables and/or values
//Example: Arithmetic operators:
var x = 5 + 3; //the '+' operator adds 5 and 3 together to get result 8.

//Assignment operators assign values to Javascript variables
//Example: Assignment operators
var y=5;// Assigns the value 5 to the variable y
 x+=5;//executes as x = x + 5
 
 //String operators include the + and += operator used to concatenate (add) strings
 //Example: String operators 
 var str = "Good " + "Morning";
 console.log(str)// Prints "Good Morning to the console"
 
 //Comparison operators determine equality or difference between variables or values
 //Example: Comparison operators
 8 === 8;//resolves to true
 //Logical operators determine the logic between variables or values
 //Example:Logical operators 
 true && true;// resolves to true
 
 //The typeof operator returns the type of a variable, object, function or expression 
 //Example: typeof operator
 typeof "Bob"; // returns string
