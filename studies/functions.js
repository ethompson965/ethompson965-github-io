*Functions

*0 Functions are a set of instructions in Javascript used to carry out blocks of code to
*  perform a task. 
* 1. To define a function, first enter the keyword 'function' followed by a name that you 
*would like to name the function. Immediately after the name, place open and close parenthesis
followed by open and closed brackets. Inside the parenthesis identifiers known as parameters
that just act as placeholders for a value.

//Example function:
function name(parameter) { //Declares a function named 'name' with placeholder 'parameter'
    
}
/* Inside the function body, varius statements can be made. However, the function cannot 
executed until it is invoked or 'called'. 

*/
// Example:
function toCelsius(fahrenheit) { //Declares a function named to Celsius
    return (5/9) * (fahrenheit-32); /* returns a value converted from fahrenheit to 
                                     Celsius         */
    
}
toCelsius(95); // calls a function, printing to the console a value of 35
